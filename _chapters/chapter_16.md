# Next steps for your bookstore: 

  1.  Add the ability for users to edit their reviews

  1.  Allow users to delete their reviews

  1.  If you did the previous two projects, you might want to show when a review was last edited. 

  1.  There should be a view that allows a person to see all of the reviews written by a particular user. 

  1.  It would be great to be able to upload images so that you can show people what a books cover looks like. Use the [paperclip gem](https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip) to add this functionality. You'll have to read through their documentation carefully to do this. Feel free to ask for help if you have questions.
