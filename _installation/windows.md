Before you work through the installation instructions, make sure you have an Administrator user who has rights to change your computer's settings.

{% steps %}
{% list %}
First, we'll start by downloading [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). You need a JavaScript runtime to run Rails, and Node.js is a pretty popular one ðŸ˜‰

1.  [Click here](https://nodejs.org/dist/v6.9.5/node-v6.9.5-x86.msi) to download the Node.js Windows installer.

1.  Once the download is finished, go to your Downloads directory and find the Node.js Windows Installer. The file should be named something like `node-v6.9.5-x86.msi`.

1.  Double click the file to run the installer.

    Accept the license agreement and keep all the default settings.

    If Windows asks you if you want to let the installer install software on your computer, click "Yes".

    ![Windows software installation dialog](screenshot.jpg)
{% endlist %}
{% endsteps %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
Now, we're going to install Ruby using the [RubyInstaller for Windows](https://rubyinstaller.org/).

1.  [Click here](http://dl.bintray.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/rubyinstaller-2.3.1.exe) to download the Ruby Installer.

1.  When the download finishes, go to your Downloads directory, and find the RubyInstaller. It should be named something like `rubyinstaller-2.3.1.exe`.

1.  Double click to the file to run the installer.

    You can keep most of the default settings, but on the third screen of the RubyInstaller you will need to check the option to "Add Ruby executables to your PATH".

    ![RubyInstaller with option to "Add Ruby executables to your PATH" selected](screenshot.jpg)

    When the RubyInstaller finishes your computer will have Ruby 2.3.1.
{% endlist %}
{% endsteps %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
Let's verify that the RubyInstaller *actually* installed Ruby 2.3.1 by taking a look on the Command Prompt.

1.  There are a number of ways to open Command Prompt in Windows, but I'm lazy so I just like to search for it.

    From the search bar, type "Command Prompt". The Command Prompt should be the first item in your search results.

    ![Windows search results for "Command Prompt"](screenshot.jpg)

    Then, you can open the Command Prompt from your search results.

1.  To verify your Ruby install, type `ruby -v` into the Command Prompt and press `Enter`.

    `ruby -v` will print the complete version information for the version of Ruby installed on your computer.

    If the RubyInstaller did its job, `ruby -v` should print at least "ruby 2.3.1".

    ```shell
    ruby -v
    ruby 2.3.1p112 (2016-04-26 revision 54768) [i386-mingw32]
    ```

    If you don't see something like "ruby 2.3.1", try re-running the RubyInstaller and make sure you have the "Add Ruby executables to you PATH" option selected.
{% endlist %}

{% highlight shell %}
C:\Users\awesomesauce>ruby -v
ruby 2.3.1p112 (2016-04-26 revision 54768) [i386-mingw32]
{% endhighlight %}
{% endsteps %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
To make your development experience just a little bit nicer, we'll now install the [RubyInstaller DevKit](https://rubyinstaller.org/add-ons/devkit/).

1.  [Click here](http://dl.bintray.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/DevKit-mingw64-32-4.7.2-20130224-1151-sfx.exe) to download the RubyInstaller DevKit.

1.  Once the download is finished, go to your Downloads directory and find the DevKit package. It should be named something like `DevKit-mingw64-32-4.7.2-20130224-1151-sfx.exe`.

1.  Double click the file to install the DevKit.

    When prompted, extract the contents of the DevKit into `C:\RubyDevKit`.

    ![Dialog to extract the RubyInstaller DevKit into C:\RubyDevKit](screenshot.jpg)

1.  To install the DevKit we'll need to run a couple of commands. Open the Command Prompt.

    First, run

    ```shell
    ruby C:\RubyDevKit\dk.rb init
    ```

    to initialize the DevKit.

    Then, run

    ```shell
    ruby C:\RubyDevKit\dk.rb install
    ```

    to install it on your computer.
{% endlist %}

{% highlight shell %}
C:\Users\awesomesauce>ruby C:\RubyDevKit\dk.rb init

Initialization complete! Please review and modify the auto-generated 'config.yml' file to ensure it contains the root directories to all of hte installed Rubies you want enhanced by the DevKit.

{% endhighlight %}
{% endsteps %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
Before you can install Rails, you'll need to apply an update for [RubyGems](http://guides.rubygems.org/ssl-certificate-update/).

1.  [Click here](https://rubygems.org/downloads/rubygems-update-2.6.7.gem) to download the RubyGems update.

    Just like the previous things you downloaded, the RubyGems update will also be downloaded into your Downloads directory.

1.  After the download finishes, open Command Prompt.

1.  Let's see if we can find the RubyGems update file from the Command Prompt.

    The RubyInstaller DevKit includes some additional commands that you can run on the Command Prompt. To make these commands available, run the following:

    ```shell
    C:\RubyDevKit\devkitvars.bat
    ```

1.  Now, try running the following command:

    ```shell
    ls -l Downloads
    ```

    This will list all the contents of your Downloads directory. It might be a little messy, but somewhere in there you should see a file named `rubygems-update-2.6.7.gem`.

    The full path to the RubyGems update is `C:\Users\USERNAME\Downloads\rubygems-update-2.6.7.gem` where USERNAME is your username.

1.  If you've found the RubyGems update file in your Downloads directory, you can move on to the next step.

    Otherwise, you'll need to download the RubyGems update and make sure it's in your Donwloads directory.

{% endhighlight %}
{% endsteps %}

{% protip %}
The `devkitvars.bat` file that ships with the RubyInstaller DevKit gives you access to commands you typically only find on Linux machines. You don't need these commands on Windows, but they can make your life (and mine) just a little bit easier. ðŸ˜Š

In the rest of the installation guide, whenever you're asked to open the Command Prompt please run `C:\RubyDevKit\devkitvars.bat`.
{% endprotip %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
1.  Now, we're ready to install the RubyGems update. Run the following command, but replace USERNAME with your username.

    ```shell
    gem install --local C:\Users\USERNAME\downloads\rubygems-update-2.6.7.gem --no-document
    ```

1.  Then, run the update:

    ```shell
    update_rubygems --no-document
    ```

1.  Run the following command to verify that the update was installed:

    ```shell
    gem --version
    ```

    It should return 2.6.7.

1.  Now that you've installed the update, you can remove the update file. Run:

    ```shell
    gem uninstall rubygems-update -x
    ```
{% endlist %}

{% highlight shell %}

Now, we're ready to install Rails! ðŸŽ‰

1.  Open the Command Prompt and run the following command to install Rails:

    ```shell
    gem install rails --version 5.0.1 --no-document
    ```

    Windows Firewall may ask you to give Ruby access to public networks. If it does, click "Allow access".

    ![Windows Firewall asking to give Ruby permission to the internet](screenshot.jpg)

1.  To verify the install, run

    ```shell
    rails -v
    ```

    It should return Rails 5.0.1.
{% endlist %}

{% highlight shell %}

{% endhighlight %}
{% endsteps %}

{% steps %}
{% list %}
Finally, we'll check if everything is working by creating a new Rails app.

1.  Open the Command Prompt and run the following command to create a new Rails app called "installfest".

    ```shell
    rails new installfest
    ```

    This will add a new directory to your computer named "installfest". It will have all the contents of a new Rails application.

1.  From Command Prompt, go into the new "installfest" directory by running:

    ```shell
    cd installfest
    ```

1.  Now, start the Rails application by running

    ```shell
    rails server
    ```

1.  Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the running application!

    ![Browser showing "Yay! You're on Rails"](screenshot.jpg)

1.  Now that you've verified everything is working, you can stop the application by running `Ctrl-c` in the Command Prompt.

1.  You can also remove the "installfest" directory by running the following commands:

    ```shell
    cd ..
    rm -rf installfest
    ```
{% endlist %}

{% highlight shell %}
